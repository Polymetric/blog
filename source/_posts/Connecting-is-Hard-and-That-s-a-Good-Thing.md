**We** always hear people, (teachers in school, professors, people online) talk about how hard it is to “connect” with the younger generations. How they aren’t interested in what they need to learn, only their phones and their Facebook accounts and grumpy cats.

**While** I agree with that statement, I don’t see it as a necessarily negative one. For most of my life, I’ve played video games, the majority of which were on a PC, one of the perks of having a dad who worked in IT. One of the common threads of discussion around PC gaming now is the term “hardcore”, and what that really means. To most, it means you play games for the challenge, and enjoy the difficulty as much as the outcome.

**The** complaint that kids are “hard to connect to” is just that, a challenge. Sure, it’s harder. But the reward, and the things you have to think up to get to that reward are that much better because of it. During my time working on Minecraft U this past year, I found that with the right ideas, and with enough clever thinking, you can get kids interested in just about anything, from math and programming to interior design and color theory.

**The** trick, for our team at least, was using something that they already enjoyed. In this case, it was Minecraft. Because of its sandbox nature, the game lends itself easily to almost any subject you could think of.

**If** traditional methods of teaching computer science worked, we wouldn’t have gotten the opportunity to do what we do. Some of the kids we introduced to programming might not have gotten that until college. And the reward, seeing an entire roomful of kids suddenly realize exactly how binary works, is so much better because of the challenge of getting there.

**So** sure, the education industry is in an arms race with the Internet for children’s attention spans, but without that race, the progress made in making education fun wouldn’t have happened.

**And** that would be a shame, because learning is fun. Let’s make it even better.
